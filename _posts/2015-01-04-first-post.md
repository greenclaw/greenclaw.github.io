My name is Roman Anderson, I am a software engineer and web-developer.
A few years ago I can't even imagine that I will start writing own blog.
Since this time I have meet a lot of people that ask me an advice or help.
I will try to write here the most interesting stories from my life which I have been facing during my professional career.
